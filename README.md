# SpotifyDownloader
A simple, Python-based mechanism for getting local copies of your Spotify songs and playlists. Functions by looking at the window's title which details the song name and author, and records your audio loopback (commonly called "Stereo Mix" or "What U Hear"). Currently only has a terminal interface and saves all songs as .wav only. Also is currently only compatible with Windows. Only tested on Windows 10 x64.

Requirements:
Python 3
pywin32
pyaudio
